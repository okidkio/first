*Sustainable Crop Managment [using machine learning]* 

This project i am currently doing as a major project with my group menebers for graduation. 
Our aim is to build a website which can help in giving aprroximate values of Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium
required in the soil as per the crop that will be planted. With this the framer can cehck it's soil content 
and use fertilizer's accordingly.
   With this our aim is to minimize the use of fertilizers along with herbicides, intecticides, and fungicides.
The minimum the use of fertilizers the minimum the speed of leeaching which cause water pollution. 
Also to slow down/ stop soil pollution, air pollution and crop damage.
